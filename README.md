# Virtual Art Gallery Project
This is a project that simulates an art gallery. It is a console application that uses a variety of data structures like a Binary Search Tree (BST), a Hash Table, a Heap, and a Linked List. The application loads users and employees from a text file database. You can log into the console as an employee, a costumer or a guest. The user can list all available paintings by title or price in ascending order. 

## Here is some more specific functionality

* Users can create customer or employee accounts
* They can also search for paintings by their title or price  
* Employees can access all orders
* The application specified which orders have been shipped (no orders have really been shipped since this is not a real store)
* Employees can also search for customers by name
* Employees can view all orders made by a customer
* Employees can ship orders
